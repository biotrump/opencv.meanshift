[if you get "ldconfig: command not found", try using "/sbin/ldconfig"]

If you don't do the 'make install' part, you can still use the libraries from
the buildgtk directory, but they may not be available to other users.

If you want to remove wxWidgets on Unix you can do this:

> su <type root password>
> make uninstall
> ldconfig

Note that by default, GTK+ 2.x is used. GTK+ 3 can be specified
with --with-gtk=3.

* The expert case
-----------------

If you want to do some more serious cross-platform programming with wxWidgets,
such as for GTK+ and Motif, you can now build two complete libraries and use
them concurrently. To do this, create a separate directory for each build
of wxWidgets - you may also want to create different versions of wxWidgets
and test them concurrently. Most typically, this would be a version configured
with --enable-debug and one without.

For building three versions (one GTK+, one Motif and a debug version of the GTK
source) you'd do this:

mkdir buildmotif
cd buildmotif
../configure --with-motif
make
cd ..

mkdir buildgtk
cd buildgtk
../configure --with-gtk
make
cd ..

mkdir buildgtkd
cd buildgtkd
../configure --with-gtk --enable-debug
make
cd ..
